JavaScript IDE for sublime text

<p>

I'm implementing new features thanks to <strong>Flow</strong> (static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other <strong>features</strong> and there will be a better <strong>autocomplete</strong>
(<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">smart autocomplete based on the current context</strong>).

This is in <strong>Beta version</strong>.

I will move it on a new repository (<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">so it will be a new plugin on Sublime Text</strong>)
because it will offer not only a better autocomplete but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing javascript projects, such as:

- Cordova projects (run Cordova emulator, build, compile, serve Cordova projects, add plugins and platforms, etc … directly on Sublime Text!)
- Ionic projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Node.js projects
- Local bookmarks project
- Show javascript errors with Flow
- etc, etc …

It will be something like a <strong>JavaScript IDE</strong> on Sublime Text!

It isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!
I will let you know the moment I have any news!!

Email me for any questions or doubts about this new project on: <a href="mailto:pichillilorenzo@gmail.com">pichillilorenzo@gmail.com</a>

<strong>Thanks for your support!!!</strong>

# JavaScript Enhancements

**JavaScript Enhancements** is a plugin for **Sublime Text 3**.

I'm implementing new features thanks to **[Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)** (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

This is in **Beta version**. 

**It isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!**

**Watch** this repository to stay tuned for any news!

It will offer not only a better **javascript autocomplete** but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing **javascript projects**, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular projects
- React projects
- Node.js projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript errors with Flow
- etc.

It will turn Sublime Text into a **JavaScript IDE** like!

This project is based on my other Sublime Text plugin <a href="https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions">JavaScript Completions</a>

**Note**: 
If you want use this plugin, you may want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uninstall/disable</span> the JavaScript Completions plugin, if installed.

JavaScript Completions <strong>v3 Beta Version</strong> for sublime text

It helps you to write your scripts more quickly with hints and completions.

<p>
I'm implementing new features thanks to <strong>Flow</strong> (static type checker from Facebook).
With it I can implement other <strong>features</strong> and there will be a better <strong>autocomplete</strong>
(<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">smart autocomplete based on the current context</strong>).

This is in <strong>Beta version</strong>!!

But it isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!
I will let you know the moment I have any news!!

<strong>Thanks for your support!!!</strong>

# JavaScript Enhancements

**JavaScript Enhancements** is a plugin for **Sublime Text 3**.

I'm implementing new features thanks to **[Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow)** (javascript static type checker from Facebook).

This is in **Beta version**. 

**It isn’t ready for public testing and there isn’t a documentation at the moment!**

**Watch** this repository to stay tuned for any news!

It will offer not only a better **javascript autocomplete** but a lot of features about creating, 
developing and managing **javascript projects**, such as:

- Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)
- Ionic v1 and v2 projects (same as Cordova projects!)
- Angular projects
- React projects
- Node.js projects
- Yeoman generators
- Local bookmarks project
- JavaScript errors with Flow
- etc.

It will turn Sublime Text into a **JavaScript IDE** like!

This project is based on my other Sublime Text plugin [JavaScript Completions](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScript-Completions)

**Note**: 
If you want use this plugin, you may want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">uninstall/disable</span> the **JavaScript Completions** plugin, if installed.

## OS supported now

- Linux (64-bit)
- Mac OS X 

## Dependencies

In order to work properly, this plugin has some dependencies:

- **Node.js** and **npm** ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- **TerminalView** sublime text plugin ([TerminalView](https://github.com/Wramberg/TerminalView)) 

**Not required**, but **useful** for typescript files (Flow wont work on this type of files):

- **TypeScript** sublime text plugin ([TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin)) 

### Flow Requirements

It will use [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) for type checking and auto-completions.

- Mac OS X
- Linux (64-bit)
- Windows (64-bit)

You can find more information about Flow on [flow.org](https://flow.org)
